MCP configuration reference
This article provides a reference for the MCP server configuration file format, related commands, and settings in VS Code. For information about adding and managing MCP servers, see Add and manage MCP servers.
Configuration file
MCP server configuration is stored in the mcp.json JSON file. This file can be in your workspace (.vscode/mcp.json) or in your user profile. VS Code provides IntelliSense for the configuration file.
Note
VS Code forwards the servers you configure to the Agent Host, except servers that require interactive input (for example, ${input:...} variables). The Agent Host doesn't read .vscode/mcp.json directly; for portable configuration, use a workspace .mcp.json or user ~/.copilot/mcp-config.json file, which the Agent Host reads natively. See behavior on the extension host.
Configuration structure
The configuration file has three main sections:
"servers": {}: an object that maps server names to their configurations. Each key is the server name, and the value is the server configuration object. Depending on the server type, different fields are required.
"inputs": []: an optional array of input variable definitions for sensitive information like API keys.
"sandbox": {}: an optional object that defines file system and network access rules for sandboxed servers. See Sandbox configuration. Only applies on macOS and Linux.
You can use predefined variables in the server configuration, for example to refer to the workspace folder (${workspaceFolder}).
Standard I/O (stdio) servers
Use this configuration for servers that communicate through standard input and output streams. This is the most common type for locally-run MCP servers.
Field
Required
Description
Examples
type
Yes
Server connection type
"stdio"
command
Yes
Command to start the server executable. Must be available on your system path or contain its full path.
"npx", "node", "python", "docker"
args
No
Array of arguments passed to the command
["server.py", "--port", "3000"]
cwd
No
Working directory for the server command. Defaults to the workspace folder when run in a workspace.
"${workspaceFolder}"
env
No
Environment variables for the server. Values can be strings, numbers, or null.
{"API_KEY": "${input:api-key}"}
envFile
No
Path to an environment file to load more variables
"${workspaceFolder}/.env"
dev
No
Development mode settings to watch for file changes and debug the server. See Development mode.
{"watch": "src/**/*.ts"}
sandboxEnabled
No
Run the server in a sandboxed environment. Only supported on macOS and Linux.
true
Note
When using Docker with stdio servers, don't use the detach option (-d). The server must run in the foreground to communicate with VS Code.
Example local server configuration
This example shows the minimal configuration for a basic, local MCP server using npx:
{
"servers": {
"memory": {
"command": "npx",
"args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"]
}
}
}
Sandbox configuration
You can enable sandboxing for locally-running stdio MCP servers to restrict their access to the file system and network. Sandboxed servers can only access the file system paths and network domains that you explicitly permit. Sandboxing is available on macOS and Linux only.
To enable sandboxing for a server, set \"sandboxEnabled\": true in its configuration. Then, define a top-level sandbox object to specify the file system and network access rules. The sandbox object is a sibling of servers and inputs, and its rules apply to all sandboxed servers. When a sandboxed server needs access that the current rules don't permit, check the server output for error messages and update the sandbox configuration accordingly.
Note
When sandboxing is enabled, tool confirmations are auto-approved because the server runs in a controlled environment.
The sandbox object supports the following properties:
Property
Type
Description
filesystem.allowWrite
string[]
File paths that the server is allowed to write to.
filesystem.denyRead
string[]
File paths that the server is not allowed to read.
filesystem.denyWrite
string[]
File paths that the server is not allowed to write to.
network.allowedDomains
string[]
Domains that the server is allowed to access. Wildcards are supported, for example *.example.com.
network.deniedDomains
string[]
Domains that the server is not allowed to access.
You can use predefined variables, such as ${workspaceFolder}, in file system path values.
Example sandbox configuration
This example enables sandboxing and grants write access to the workspace, denies read access to the .ssh directory, and allows network access to specific domains:
{
"servers": {
"myServer": {
"type": "stdio",
"command": "npx",
"args": ["-y", "@example/mcp-server"],
"sandboxEnabled": true
}
},
"sandbox": {
"filesystem": {
"allowWrite": ["${workspaceFolder}"],
"denyRead": ["${userHome}/.ssh"]
},
"network": {
"allowedDomains": ["api.example.com", "*.cdn.example.com"]
}
}
}
HTTP and Server-Sent Events (SSE) servers
Use this configuration for servers that communicate over HTTP. VS Code first tries the HTTP Stream transport and falls back to SSE if HTTP is not supported.
Field
Required
Description
Examples
type
Yes
Server connection type
"http", "sse"
url
Yes
URL of the server
"http://localhost:3000", "https://api.example.com/mcp"
headers
No
HTTP headers for authentication or configuration
{"Authorization": "Bearer ${input:api-token}"}
oauth
No
OAuth configuration for authenticating with the server
{"clientId": "example-client-id"}
In addition to servers available over the network, VS Code can connect to MCP servers listening for HTTP traffic on Unix sockets or Windows named pipes by specifying the socket or pipe path in the form unix:///path/to/server.sock or pipe:///pipe/named-pipe on Windows. You can specify subpaths by using a URL fragment, such as unix:///tmp/server.sock#/mcp/subpath.
The oauth object supports the following properties:
Property
Type
Required
Description
clientId
string
Yes
The OAuth client ID to use when authenticating with the server.
enterpriseManaged
boolean
No
(Preview) Authenticate through the enterprise single sign-on (SSO) issuer configured by the mcp.enterpriseManagedAuth.idp setting, using the OAuth Identity Assertion Authorization Grant (ID-JAG). After a one-time sign-in, subsequent enterprise-managed servers connect silently. Default is false.
Note
When oauth is configured, VS Code handles the OAuth flow automatically. A browser window opens for authorization on the first connection to the server.
Example remote server configuration
This example shows the minimal configuration for a remote MCP server without authentication:
{
"servers": {
"context7": {
"type": "http",
"url": "https://mcp.context7.com/mcp"
}
}
}
Example HTTP server with OAuth
This example shows the configuration for an MCP server that uses OAuth for authentication. On first use, VS Code opens a browser window to complete the OAuth flow.
{
"servers": {
"slack": {
"type": "http",
"url": "https://mcp.slack.com/mcp",
"oauth": {
"clientId": "example-client-id"
}
}
}
}
Input variables for sensitive data
Input variables let you define placeholders for configuration values, avoiding the need to hardcode sensitive information like API keys or passwords directly in the server configuration.
When you reference an input variable using ${input:variable-id}, VS Code prompts you for the value when the server starts for the first time. The value is then securely stored for subsequent use. Learn more about input variables in VS Code.
Each input variable has a type that determines how VS Code prompts for the value. The following input types are supported:
promptString: opens an input box to ask the user for a free-text value.
pickString: shows a list of options for the user to choose from.
command: runs a command and uses its result as the input value.
Common properties:
Field
Required
Description
Example
type
Yes
Type of input prompt: promptString, pickString, or command
"promptString"
id
Yes
Unique identifier to reference in server config
"api-key", "database-url"
promptString properties:

Example server configuration with input variables
This example configures a local server that requires an API key:
{
"inputs": [
{
"type": "promptString",
"id": "perplexity-key",
"description": "Perplexity API Key",
"password": true
}
],
"servers": {
"perplexity": {
"type": "stdio",
"command": "npx",
"args": ["-y", "server-perplexity-ask"],
"env": {
"PERPLEXITY_API_KEY": "${input:perplexity-key}"
}
}
}
}
Development mode
You can enable development mode for MCP servers by adding a dev key to the server configuration. This is an object with two properties:
watch: A glob pattern, or an array of glob patterns, to watch for file changes that restart the MCP server. Available for all server types.
debug: Enables you to set up a debugger with the MCP server. Currently, VS Code supports debugging Node.js and Python MCP servers. Available for stdio servers only.
Learn more about MCP development mode in the MCP Dev Guide.
Server naming conventions
When defining MCP servers, follow these naming conventions for the server name:
Use camelCase for the server name, such as "uiTesting" or "githubIntegration"
Avoid using whitespace or special characters
Use a unique name for each server to avoid conflicts
Use a descriptive name that reflects the server's functionality or brand, such as "github" or "database"
