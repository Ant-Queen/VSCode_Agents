AI features in VS Code cheat sheet
Visual Studio Code provides AI-powered autonomous agents, inline suggestions, chat, and smart actions. Agents plan, implement, and verify changes across multiple files and run in parallel, locally, in the background, or in the cloud. Choose from multiple AI models, connect to external tools with MCP, and customize agents for your team's workflows. This cheat sheet gives you a quick overview of all features.
Tip
If you don't yet have a Copilot subscription, you can use Copilot for free by signing up for the Copilot Free plan and get a monthly allowance of inline suggestions and AI credits.

Chat participants
Use chat participants to handle domain-specific requests in chat. Chat participants are prefixed with @ and can be used to ask questions about specific topics. VS Code provides built-in chat participants, such as @github, @terminal, and @vscode, and extensions can provide additional participants.
Chat participant
Description

Use agents
When using agents, you can use natural language to specify a high-level task, and let AI autonomously reason about the request, plan the work needed, and apply the changes to your codebase. Agents use a combination of code editing and tool invocation to accomplish the task you specified. As it processes your request, it monitors the outcome of edits and tools, and iterates to resolve any issues that arise.
Action
Description
⇧⌘I (Windows Ctrl+Shift+I, Linux Ctrl+Shift+Alt+I)
Switch to using agents in the Chat view
Tools ()

Open in VS Code
Open in VS Code Insiders
).
Auto-approve terminal commands
Enable auto-approval of terminal commands when using agents (
chat.tools.terminal.autoApprove
Open in VS Code
Open in VS Code Insiders
).
MCP

Tips
Add extra tools when using agents to extend its capabilities.
Configure custom agents to define how the agent should operate, for example to implement a read-only planning mode.
Define custom instructions to guide agents on how to generate and structure code.
Try third-party agents like Claude Code or OpenAI Codex for alternative agentic coding experiences.
Planning

Select the Plan agent from the agents dropdown or use the /plan slash command to create a detailed implementation plan for complex coding tasks.
Todo list
View a todo list to track progress on complex tasks. Enable this with the setting(chat.tools.todos.showWidget setting.
Memory
Agents save and recall persistent notes across conversations. Use the Chat: Show Memory Files command to view stored memories.
Customize your chat experience
Customize your chat experience to generate responses that match your coding style, tools, and developer workflow. There are several ways to customize your chat experience in VS Code:
Custom instructions: Define common guidelines or rules for tasks like generating code, performing code reviews, or generating commit messages. Custom instructions describe the conditions in which the AI should operate (how a task should be done).
Reusable prompt files: Define reusable prompts for common tasks like generating code or performing a code review. Prompt files are standalone prompts that you can run directly in chat. They describe the task to be performed (what should be done).
Custom agents: Define how chat operates, which tools it can use, and how it interacts with the codebase. Each chat prompt is run within the boundaries of the agent, without having to configure tools and instructions for every request.
Use the Agent Customizations editor (Preview) to discover, create, and manage all your customizations in one place. Select Configure Chat (gear icon) in the Chat view, or run Chat: Open Customizations from the Command Palette.
Tips
Define language-specific instructions to get more accurate generated code for each language.
Store your instructions in your workspace to easily share them with your team.
Define reusable prompt files for common tasks to save time and help team members get started quickly.
