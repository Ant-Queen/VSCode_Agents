Agent hooks in Visual Studio Code (Preview)
Hooks enable you to execute custom shell commands at key lifecycle points during agent sessions. Use hooks to automate workflows, enforce security policies, validate operations, and integrate with external tools.
Hooks work across agent harnesses and execution environments. Each hook receives structured JSON input and can return JSON output to influence agent behavior.
For background on how hooks fit into the AI customization framework, see Customization concepts.
This article explains how to configure and use hooks in VS Code.
Note
Agent hooks are currently in Preview. The configuration format and behavior might change in future releases.
Important
Your organization might have disabled the use of hooks in VS Code. Contact your admin for more information. See enterprise policies for details.
Why use hooks?
Hooks provide deterministic, code-driven automation. Unlike instructions or custom prompts that guide agent behavior, hooks execute your code at specific lifecycle points with guaranteed outcomes. Some common use cases for hooks include:
Enforce security policies: Block dangerous commands like rm -rf or DROP TABLE before they execute, regardless of how the agent was prompted.
Automate code quality: Run formatters, linters, or tests automatically after file modifications.
Create audit trails: Log every tool invocation, command execution, or file change for compliance and debugging.
Inject context: Add project-specific information, API keys, or environment details to help the agent make better decisions.
Control approvals: Automatically approve safe operations while requiring confirmation for sensitive ones.
Quick start: your first hook
The following example creates a hook that runs Prettier after the agent uses a tool, such as editing a file. Create a .github/hooks/format.json file in your workspace:
{
"hooks": {
"PostToolUse": [
{
"type": "command",
"command": "npx prettier --write ."
}
]
}
}
After you save this file, VS Code automatically loads the hook. The next time the agent edits a file, Prettier formats your workspace. You can check that the hook executed by looking at the agent debug logs (run the Developer: Show Agent Debug Logs command).
This hook runs a single command and ignores its input. To build hooks that react to what the agent did, such as formatting only the file that changed, see How hooks work and Usage scenarios.
How hooks work
When a hook event fires, VS Code runs your command and passes information about the event as a JSON object on standard input (stdin). Your command can write a JSON object to standard output (stdout) to pass context back to the agent or to control what happens next, such as blocking a tool call.
A hook has three parts:
An event that determines when the hook runs (see Hook lifecycle events).
A command that VS Code runs when the event fires.
Optional JSON input and output that lets the command read event details and influence the agent.
Basic hooks, like the quick start example, ignore the input and just run a command. More advanced hooks read the JSON from stdin to make decisions. For the full set of input and output fields, see Hook input and output.
Hook lifecycle events
VS Code supports eight hook events that fire at specific points during an agent session:
Hook Event
When It Fires
Common Use Cases
SessionStart
User submits the first prompt of a new session
Initialize resources, log session start, validate project state
UserPromptSubmit
User submits a prompt
Audit user requests, inject system context
PreToolUse
Before agent invokes any tool
Block dangerous operations, require approval, modify tool input
PostToolUse
After tool completes successfully
Run formatters, log results, trigger follow-up actions
PreCompact
Before conversation context is compacted
Export important context, save state before truncation
SubagentStart
Subagent is spawned
Track nested agent usage, initialize subagent resources
SubagentStop
Subagent completes
Aggregate results, cleanup subagent resources
Stop
Agent session ends
Generate reports, cleanup resources, send notifications
For the full input and output schema of each event, see the Hooks reference.
Configure hooks
Hooks are configured in JSON files stored in your workspace or user directory.
Hook file locations
VS Code searches for hook configuration files in these locations:
Tip
In a monorepo, enable
chat.useCustomizationsInParentRepositories
Open in VS Code
Open in VS Code Insiders
to discover hooks from the parent repository root. Learn more about parent repository discovery.
Scope
Default file location
Workspace
.github/hooks/*.json
Workspace (Claude format)
.claude/settings.json, .claude/settings.local.json
User
~/.copilot/hooks, ~/.claude/settings.json
Custom agent
hooks field in .agent.md frontmatter (see Agent-scoped hooks)
Plugin
hooks.json or hooks/hooks.json, depending on the plugin format (see Hooks in plugins)
Workspace hooks take precedence over user hooks for the same event type.
Use the
chat.hookFilesLocations
Open in VS Code
Open in VS Code Insiders
setting to customize which files are loaded. Specify folders (all *.json files in the folder are loaded) or individual .json files, using relative or tilde (~) paths. The default value includes these locations:
"chat.hookFilesLocations": {
".github/hooks": true,
".claude/settings.local.json": true,
".claude/settings.json": true,
"~/.claude/settings.json": true
}
To customize, add an entry for a new location, or set a path to false to disable a location (including the defaults):
"chat.hookFilesLocations": {
"custom/hooks": true,              // load all *.json files in a folder
"~/my-hooks/security.json": true,  // load a specific file
".claude/settings.json": false     // stop loading Claude Code hooks
}
Hook configuration format
Create a JSON file with a hooks object containing arrays of hook commands for each event type. VS Code uses the same hook format as Claude Code and Copilot CLI for compatibility:
{
"hooks": {
"PreToolUse": [
{
"type": "command",
"command": "./scripts/validate-tool.sh",
"timeout": 15
}
],
"PostToolUse": [
{
"type": "command",
"command": "npx prettier --write ."
}
]
}
}
Hook command properties
Each hook entry must specify type: "command" and a command to run. You can also configure a working directory (cwd), environment variables (env), a timeout, and OS-specific overrides (windows, linux, osx). For the full list of properties, see the Hook command properties reference.
Note
OS-specific commands are selected based on the extension host platform. In remote development scenarios (SSH, Containers, WSL), this might differ from your local operating system.
OS-specific commands
Specify different commands for each operating system:
{
"hooks": {
"PostToolUse": [
{
"type": "command",
"command": "./scripts/format.sh",
"windows": "powershell -File scripts\\format.ps1",
"linux": "./scripts/format-linux.sh",
"osx": "./scripts/format-mac.sh"
}
]
}
}
The execution service selects the appropriate command based on your OS. If no OS-specific command is defined, it falls back to the command property.
Agent-scoped hooks
Note
Agent-scoped hooks are currently in preview.
You can define hooks directly in a custom agent's YAML frontmatter. Agent-scoped hooks only run when that custom agent is active, either selected by the user or invoked as a subagent. Agent-scoped hooks run in addition to any workspace or user-level hooks configured for the same event.
To enable agent-scoped hooks, set
chat.useCustomAgentHooks
Open in VS Code
Open in VS Code Insiders
to true.
Add a hooks field to the agent frontmatter with the same structure as hook configuration files: event names mapped to arrays of hook command objects.
---
name: "Strict Formatter"
description: "Agent that auto-formats code after every edit"
hooks:
PostToolUse:
- type: command
command: "./scripts/format-changed-files.sh"
---
You are a code editing agent. After making changes, files are automatically formatted.
Create and edit hooks
You have multiple options for creating and editing hooks. You can create hook configuration files manually in one of the supported locations, use commands to create a new hook, or generate a hook with AI.
Manually manage hook files:
Create or edit a .json file in a supported location (for example, .github/hooks/security.json) and add your hook configuration.
Save the file and it is automatically loaded by VS Code.
Use commands to manage hooks
Run the Chat: Configure Hooks command from the Command Palette (⇧⌘P (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Shift+P)).
You can also type /hooks in the chat input and press Enter to open the configure hooks menu.
Follow the prompts to select an event type, choose a file location, and configure the command.
The command creates a new hook file and opens it in the editor for you to customize. Save the file to load the hook.
Use the Agent Customizations editor:
Open the Agent Customizations editor by running the Chat: Open Customizations command.
Alternatively, select Open Customizations (gear icon) at the top of the Chat view.
Select the Hooks tab to view and manage your hooks.
Select Configure Hooks from the dropdown button.
Follow the prompts to select an event type, choose a file location, and configure the command.
The command creates a new hook file and opens it in the editor for you to customize. Save the file to load the hook.
Generate a hook with AI:
Type /create-hook in chat and describe the automation you want (for example, /create-hook run ESLint after every file edit).
Alternatively, run the Chat: Generate Hook command from the Command Palette (⇧⌘P (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Shift+P)) or select Generate Hook in the Agent Customizations editor.
The agent asks clarifying questions and generates a hook configuration file with the appropriate event type, command, and settings.
Hook input and output
Hooks communicate with VS Code through stdin (input) and stdout (output) using JSON.
Common input fields
Every hook receives a JSON object via stdin with these common fields:
Field
Type
Description
timestamp
string
ISO 8601 timestamp when the hook fired
cwd
string
(Optional) Working directory for the agent session
session_id
string
(Optional) Unique identifier for the current agent session
hook_event_name
string
Name of the hook event (for example, PreToolUse)
transcript_path
string
(Optional) Absolute path to a file containing the session conversation transcript
Note
transcript_path is provided for convenience — for example, logging, auditing, or lightweight checks such as whether a file was read during the session. The transcript file format is not a stable hook API and may change in future VS Code releases. Prefer the documented hook input fields (tool_name, tool_input, prompt, and so on) whenever possible.
Common output format
Hooks can return JSON via stdout to influence agent behavior. All hooks support these output fields:
{
"continue": true,
"stopReason": "Security policy violation",
"systemMessage": "Unit tests failed"
}
Field
Type
Description
continue
boolean
Set to false to stop processing (default: true)
stopReason
string
Reason for stopping, when continue is false (shown to the user)
systemMessage
string
Warning message displayed to the user
Exit codes
The hook's exit code determines how VS Code handles the result:
Exit Code
Behavior
0
Success: parse stdout as JSON
2
Blocking error: stop processing and show error to model
Other
Non-blocking warning: show warning to user, continue processing
Choosing how to return data
Hooks have several ways to control agent behavior: exit codes, top-level output fields (continue, stopReason), and hook-specific output fields (hookSpecificOutput). Use them in combination as follows:
Exit code 2 is the simplest way to block an operation. The hook's stderr is shown to the model as context. No JSON output is needed.
continue: false in the JSON output stops the entire agent session. Use stopReason to tell the user why. This is more drastic than blocking a single tool call.
hookSpecificOutput provides fine-grained control specific to each hook event. For example, PreToolUse hooks use permissionDecision to allow, deny, or prompt for a single tool call without stopping the session.
systemMessage displays a warning to the user in the chat, regardless of other decisions.
When multiple control mechanisms are used together, the most restrictive wins. For example, if a hook returns continue: false and permissionDecision: "allow", the session still stops.
Per-event input and output
Each hook event provides its own input fields and supports event-specific output. For the full input and output schema of every event, including PreToolUse, PostToolUse, SessionStart, Stop, and more, see the Hooks reference.
Usage scenarios
The following examples demonstrate common hook patterns.
Block dangerous terminal commands
Create a PreToolUse hook that prevents destructive commands:
.github/hooks/security.json:
{
"hooks": {
"PreToolUse": [
{
"type": "command",
"command": "./scripts/block-dangerous.sh",
"timeoutSec": 5
}
]
}
}
scripts/block-dangerous.sh:
#!/bin/bash
INPUT=$(cat)
TOOL_NAME=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.tool_name')
TOOL_INPUT=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.tool_input')
if [ "$TOOL_NAME" = "runTerminalCommand" ]; then
COMMAND=$(echo "$TOOL_INPUT" | jq -r '.command // empty')
if echo "$COMMAND" | grep -qE '(rm\s+-rf|DROP\s+TABLE|DELETE\s+FROM)'; then
echo '{"hookSpecificOutput":{"permissionDecision":"deny","permissionDecisionReason":"Destructive command blocked by security policy"}}'
exit 0
fi
fi
echo '{"continue":true}'
Auto-format code after edits
Run Prettier automatically after any file modification:
.github/hooks/formatting.json:
{
"hooks": {
"PostToolUse": [
{
"type": "command",
"command": "./scripts/format-changed-files.sh",
"windows": "powershell -File scripts\\format-changed-files.ps1",
"timeout": 30
}
]
}
}
scripts/format-changed-files.sh:
#!/bin/bash
INPUT=$(cat)
TOOL_NAME=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.tool_name')
if [ "$TOOL_NAME" = "editFiles" ] || [ "$TOOL_NAME" = "createFile" ]; then
FILES=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.tool_input.files[]? // .tool_input.path // empty')
for FILE in $FILES; do
if [ -f "$FILE" ]; then
npx prettier --write "$FILE" 2>/dev/null
fi
done
fi
echo '{"continue":true}'
Log tool usage for auditing
Create an audit trail of all tool invocations:
.github/hooks/audit.json:
{
"hooks": {
"PreToolUse": [
{
"type": "command",
"command": "./scripts/log-tool-use.sh",
"env": {
"AUDIT_LOG": ".github/hooks/audit.log"
}
}
]
}
}
scripts/log-tool-use.sh:
#!/bin/bash
INPUT=$(cat)
TIMESTAMP=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.timestamp')
TOOL_NAME=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.tool_name')
SESSION_ID=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.sessionId')
echo "[$TIMESTAMP] Session: $SESSION_ID, Tool: $TOOL_NAME" >> "${AUDIT_LOG:-audit.log}"
echo '{"continue":true}'
Require approval for specific tools
Force manual confirmation for tools that modify infrastructure:
.github/hooks/approval.json:
{
"hooks": {
"PreToolUse": [
{
"type": "command",
"command": "./scripts/require-approval.sh"
}
]
}
}
scripts/require-approval.sh:
#!/bin/bash
INPUT=$(cat)
TOOL_NAME=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.tool_name')
# Tools that should always require approval
SENSITIVE_TOOLS="runTerminalCommand|deleteFile|pushToGitHub"
if echo "$TOOL_NAME" | grep -qE "^($SENSITIVE_TOOLS)$"; then
echo '{"hookSpecificOutput":{"permissionDecision":"ask","permissionDecisionReason":"This operation requires manual approval"}}'
else
echo '{"hookSpecificOutput":{"permissionDecision":"allow"}}'
fi
Inject project context at session start
Provide project-specific information when a session begins:
.github/hooks/context.json:
{
"hooks": {
"SessionStart": [
{
"type": "command",
"command": "./scripts/inject-context.sh"
}
]
}
}
scripts/inject-context.sh:
#!/bin/bash
PROJECT_INFO=$(cat package.json 2>/dev/null | jq -r '.name + " v" + .version' || echo "Unknown project")
BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")
cat <<EOF
{
"hookSpecificOutput": {
"hookEventName": "SessionStart",
"additionalContext": "Project: $PROJECT_INFO | Branch: $BRANCH | Node: $(node -v 2>/dev/null || echo 'not installed')"
}
}
EOF
Safety
If the agent has access to edit scripts run by hooks, then it has the ability to modify those scripts during its own run, and execute the code it writes. We recommend using the chat.tools.edits.autoApprove to disallow the agent from editing hook scripts without manual approval.
Troubleshooting
View hook diagnostics
To see which hooks are loaded and check for configuration errors:
Select View Logs to view all logs.
Look for "Load Hooks" to see loaded hooks and which locations they were loaded from.
View hook output
To review hook output and errors:
Open the Output panel.
Select GitHub Copilot Chat Hooks from the channel list.
Tip
You can also run the Developer: Show Agent Debug Logs command to view hook input and output in the agent debug logs.
Common issues
Hook not executing: Verify the hook file is in .github/hooks/ and has a .json extension. Check that the type property is set to "command".
Permission denied errors: Ensure your hook scripts have execute permissions (chmod +x script.sh).
Timeout errors: Increase the timeout value or optimize your hook script. The default is 30 seconds.
JSON parse errors: Verify your hook script outputs valid JSON to stdout. Use jq or a JSON library to construct output.
Frequently asked questions
How does VS Code handle Claude Code hook configurations?
VS Code reads hook configurations from .claude/settings.json, .claude/settings.local.json, and ~/.claude/settings.json by default. VS Code parses Claude Code's hook configuration format, including matcher syntax. Currently, VS Code ignores matcher values, so hooks run on all tool invocations regardless of the matcher.
If you are adapting a Claude Code hook for VS Code, be aware of the following differences:
Tool input property names: Claude Code uses snake_case for tool input properties (for example, tool_input.file_path), while VS Code tools use camelCase (for example, tool_input.filePath). Update your hook scripts to read the correct property names.
Tool names: Claude Code and VS Code use different tool names. For example, Claude Code uses Write and Edit for file operations, while VS Code uses tool names like create_file and replace_string_in_file. Check the tool name in the tool_name input field and update your hook logic accordingly.
Matchers are ignored: Hook matchers like "Edit|Write" are parsed but not applied. All hooks run on every matching event, regardless of the tool name in the matcher.
How does VS Code handle Copilot CLI hook configurations?
VS Code parses Copilot CLI hook configurations and converts the lowerCamelCase hook event names (like preToolUse) to the PascalCase format used by VS Code (PreToolUse). The bash and powershell command properties are mapped to OS-specific commands: powershell maps to windows, and bash maps to osx and linux.
Security considerations
Caution
Hooks execute shell commands with the same permissions as VS Code. Review hook configurations carefully, especially when using hooks from untrusted sources.
Review hook scripts: Inspect all hook scripts before enabling them, especially in shared repositories.
Limit hook permissions: Use the principle of least privilege. Hooks should only have access to what they need.
Validate input: Hook scripts receive input from the agent. Validate and sanitize all input to prevent injection attacks.
Secure credentials: Never hardcode secrets in hook scripts. Use environment variables or secure credential storage.
